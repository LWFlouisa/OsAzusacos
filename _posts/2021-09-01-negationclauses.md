## French Nouns
French nouns are generally negated by the word ne noun pas, or just a noun followed by pas in spoken French.

This language, the spelling of the word itself is modified to include the negative, and thus French negation is redudant.

Ex. Chatte, Nechatte or Chattapas.

## Japanese Negation
Formal Japanese allows you to change the spelling of a word to indicate a negative, but for the purposes of this creole language, I decided to take a different approach.

Japanese words will be negated by the term Na, with their spelling adjusted to include this word. All sentence based negative is thus rendered as a double negative. That word is Na:

Ex. Tsuname, Natsuname.

## Hybrid Negation
Creole negation uses its own negation clause. Im leaning toward either Ni or Nix for that purpose. Nix is actually used in English, but it may cause a spelling nightmare as negation here is implemented into the word itself.

Ex. Cochon Tsunami.

Or, C'est nix cochon tsunami.
